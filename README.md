#DIGIAGENDA
Description
This application is a multi-functional productivity app that helps users stay on top of their tasks and schedule. It includes features such as creating and editing tasks, setting reminders, and creating to-do lists for each day clicked. The app also provides a report on tasks completed, and a weather widget containing the description, current temperature, minimum, and maximum temperature. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for anyone to use. The technologies used in this application are JavaScript ES6, APIs for Weather and Quotes, and plugins including FullCalender js, and loading circle progress js. Challenges faced in the development of this app include creating a list tab for each day click on the calendar, making a multi filtered functionality and creating a local database to save list tabs in calender.
In the future, the application will intergrate back-end technologies Node js and Mongo DB to implement new features including user authentication and saving list tabs into database.
